<b>Brick Pong: Breakout Evolution</b> revolutionises the classic breakout genre with a <b>unique twist</b>: Experience unrestricted paddle movement in all directions, while the ball is affected by <b>gravity, friction, torque, and paddle impact</b> driven by a powerful <b>2D physics engine</b>.

This is the <b>most dynamic brick breaker game</b> you have ever tried. Conquer the <b>60 increasingly challenging levels</b>, unlock <b>five secret levels,</b> and a range of items that can aid or hinder your progress. Make split-second decisions to utilise power-ups effectively and overcome obstacles.

<strong>These items are:</strong>
<p>✔ <b>Big Ball:</b> Cuts straight through two bricks before bouncing back (unlocks on level 2)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Broad Pad:</b> Your pad grows in size, but it will give lower bonuses (unlocks on level 3)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Narrow Pad:</b> Your pad shrinks in size, but it will give higher bonuses (unlocks on level 4)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Save Tokens:</b> Save your progress any time (unlocks on level 5)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Safety barrier:</b> Collectible. Prevents the ball from falling, three time (unlocks on level 6)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Glow Dagger:</b> The more obvious name is copyrighted. Yes, that <i>is</i> sad (unlocks on level 7)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Heavy Ball:</b> Slices through  three bricks and cracks black ones (unlocks on level 8)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Pellet Guns:</b> Your pad starts shooting at bricks (unlocks on level 9)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Multi-Ball:</b> Play with three balls at once (unlocks on level 10)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Unstable Pad:</b> It just doesn't want to stay flat (unlocks on level 11)</p>

<p>✔ <b>Heavy pad:</b> It's slow heavy, it moves slower (unlocks on level 20)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Pink-PonG Ball:</b> It's so light, you need to hit everything twice with it (unlocks on level 23)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Shuriken:</b> Cuts right through all bricks, but not black or metal ones (unlocks on level 26)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Tethered Pad:</b> The pad is attached to a rail, only moving sideways (unlocks on level 29)</p>

<p>✔ <b>Fixed Teleports:</b> One-way teleports that never swap sides (appear from level 47)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Marble Ball:</b> Nothing can stop this one, not even metal bricks (unlocks on level 51)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Sticky Pad:</b> A rail-attached pad that "captures" the ball, so you can aim your shots (unlocks on level 57)</p>
<p>✔ <b>Secret Portals:</b> Hidden under metal bricks, these will lead you to secret levels when you find them. Once unlocked, they can appear on any level with at least 7 metal bricks (unlocks on level 60)</p>
