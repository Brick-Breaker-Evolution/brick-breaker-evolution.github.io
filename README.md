Brick Pong revolutionises the classic breakout genre with a **unique twist**: Experience unrestricted paddle movement in all directions, whilst the ball responds to **gravity, friction, torque, and paddle impact** driven by a powerful **2D physics engine**.

This is the **most dynamic brick breaker game** you've ever tried. Conquer the **50 increasingly challenging levels** and unlock a range of items that can aid or hinder your progress. Strategise and make split-second decisions to utilise power-ups effectively and overcome obstacles.

Complete **various challenges** to earn valuable items and extra balls, and **replay any level as many times as you like**, as each game promises a unique experience.

With its meticulously designed levels and **fast-paced, addictive gameplay**, Brick Pong seamlessly blends nostalgia with a modern twist on retro brick breaker mechanics.

**Get ready to break some bricks!**
